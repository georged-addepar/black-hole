# Black Hole
Extract value from the Black Hole of direct candidate submissions

## Overview
Greenhouse data is extracted into snowflake in real time.


This utility will extract today's direct applications from snowflake and email applications that match keyword filters to the recruiting team. The goal is to filter out the noise in the direct application channels by filtering for specific experience or prior companies.

This utility is currently a POC to see if we can extract value in this manner.
